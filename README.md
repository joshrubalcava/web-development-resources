# Web Development Resources
### Why I Created This Website
As a self-taught developer, it can often seem like there are too many resources to choose from. When I was starting out, I found it difficult to determine which resources would best suit my needs on my journey to learning how to code. This project came to mind when I thought of something I could build that has the ability to bring value to people that want to start their jouney to become developers.

### Skills Used & Learned
Over the course of this project, I wanted to continue to develop a better understanding of HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap. I had also not worked much with navigation bars, so I wanted to try to create something that added a little bit of functionality rather than just having a normal navigation bar.
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Changing Navbar Background Color)
- Bootstrap
- Git/Github
